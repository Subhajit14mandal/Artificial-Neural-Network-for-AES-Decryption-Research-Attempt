# ANNs Encryption Project 🔐🤖

This repository explores the use of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** for encryption and decryption tasks.  
It contains sample datasets, test notebooks, and experiments combining machine learning with cryptography.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `ANNs_Files.ipynb` — main notebook with model experiments  
- `ANNs_test_02.ipynb`, `ANNs_test_3.ipynb` — test notebooks  
- `ANNs_file_Encrypt_by_One_Key.csv` — dataset encrypted using a single key  
- `ANNs_file_Encrypt_Each_Line_Random_Key.csv` — dataset with random keys per line  
- `TwitterLowerAsciiCorpus.txt` — text corpus for training/testing
