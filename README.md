## 🧠 Overview

**Neural Unlock** is a conceptual project that explores how artificial intelligence can decrypt complex data structures using neural network logic and precision. At its core, it blends cybersecurity, machine learning, and visual storytelling.

This repository features a custom illustration that symbolizes the project’s mission:  
A robotic hand holding a glowing key, poised to unlock a digital padlock embedded in a radiant neural bloom. It’s a metaphor for AI’s ability to probe, interpret, and unlock encrypted systems.
